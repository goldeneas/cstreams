# CStreams

A simple, Java-inspired Streams API for C.

This library provides a basic framework for processing sequences of data using a pipeline of operations, similar to Java's `Stream` API.

## Features

* **Extensible**: Use any data source by providing two simple functions.
* **Lazy Operations**: Intermediate operations are not executed until it is required.
* **Generic**: Uses void* to allow custom types.

## How to Build
This is a library, not a standalone executable; to use it, you just need to compile your main.c with cstreams.

## How to Use
